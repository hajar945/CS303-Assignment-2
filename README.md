The program allows the user to perform the following functions with a linked list of any one data type without the use of the LIST C++ STL: push_front, push_back, pop_front, pop_back, checking if the list is empty, inserting an element at any valid position, removing an item at position index, and finding the position of the first occurrence of an item. 
 
The second part of the program allows the user to create a stack of integer values, insert integer values onto the stack, check if the stack is empty, remove an element, return the top of the stack, and return the average value of stack elements.


The user must create a linked list object and declare the desired data type. Below, the data type is 'char'. Use the function 'push_front' to load elements of the same selected data type into the linked list.
